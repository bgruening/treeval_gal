## TreeValGal demonstration workflow


With thanks to Bjoern and Anna for helping with testing and tools, there is now a WIP workflow on usegalaxy.eu that creates the two gap tracks, 
the repeats track and the coverage track for the TreeVal small sample test data. There are only 3 gaps in the test reference so hard to find them. 
The pacbio sample only covers some of a single contig, so make sure you select ENA|OV656687|OV656687.1 for display, otherwise there is no coverage 
to show in this demonstration.

History is shared and so is the workflow so please try it on your own pacbio/refseq data and let me know if this is worth more work to add 
additional TreeVal tracks to for your use?

These images are all from the one combined JBrowse, but zoomed at various levels to show how JBrowse does all the work for us. The tracks are 
history bed files if the user wants them for downstream analyses...
