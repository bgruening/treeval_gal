### [yaml_input](https://github.com/sanger-tol/treeval/blob/dev/subworkflows/local/yaml_input.nf)


This reads a yaml configuration file path passed on the NF command line and sets up parameters for the other 17 subworkflows.

If the option to use a yaml configuration file for the Galaxy workflow is desirable it can be added.

For the first translation, ignore this for the moment other than as a source for understanding parameters used in subsequent subworkflows.
